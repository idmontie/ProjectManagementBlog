Story points are abstract, versus something concrete like hours. What is important is if stories are wildly different in size.

[Reading Material - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Xx8QVnXRc), [Reading Material - Why use story points instead of hours for estimating?](http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/2765/why-use-story-points-instead-of-hours-for-estimating)

Using points is one version of what is called **relative sizing**. Most story point estimation use points related tot he lower end of the Fibonacci series (1,2,3,5,8,13) because the goal is to group things of similar overall size together. Relative size is more important that individual size.

Points prevent outside forces from holding people to estimations that might change. The collection of points is important.

We keep ourselves from wasting time on detailing out timelines that might change due to new technologies, changes in customer requirements, etc.

Story points usually incorporate a tasks overall complexity, effort, and doubt.

1. **Complexity**: Do we know how to solve this problem? Have we solved it before?
2. **Effort**: How much stuff needs to be done? Even if we know exactly how to solve a problem, it might still take a lot of effort.
3. **Doubt**: Is the task even possible? Can we actually accomplish this task with the diven technology?

The final point estimate is just a way to say:

> Taking all of these things into account, I think this is bigger than most of the things we've called a three and smaller than most of the things that we've called an eight, so it must be a five.
