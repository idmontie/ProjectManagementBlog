Work is expressed as a backlog of user stories. User stories are written from the perspective of the end user.

Team members are envouraged to think of their work from the perspective of the users who will end up using the software.

> As a [end user role], I want [the desire] so that [the rationale].

1. Identify who will benefit from the application
2. Decide who would want to decide what the user will want out of the application
3. Explain why part 2 is important for that user.

Example:

> As a PC user, I want a colculator with basic functionality on my PC so that I can conveniently perform basic mathematic operations.

User stories document requirements with particular attention to the end user's point of view.
