Work is expressed as a backlog of user stories. A user story is a distinct unit of customer-visible functionality. User stories are written from the perspective of the end user.

[Reading Material](http://www.energizedwork.com/weblog/2006/02/user-stories-part-1-what-is-user-story)

A user story is functionality which does not have to represent value to the business, but must represent progress to the customer.

[Ron Jeffries](http://ronjeffries.com/) uses `3 Cs` to decribe a user story:

1. **Card**: The name of the user story. Used to facilitate collaboration between the customer and the developers.
2. **Conversation**: Collaboration and discussion that drill-down into the details of the desired functionality.
3. **Confirmation**: Acceptance tests capturing the details and used to determine when a user story is complete.

Team members are encouraged to think of their work from the perspective of the users who will end up using the software.

> As a [end user role], I want [the desire] so that [the rationale].

1. Identify who will benefit from the application
2. Decide who would want to decide what the user will want out of the application
3. Explain why part 2 is important for that user.

Example:

> As a PC user, I want a colculator with basic functionality on my PC so that I can conveniently perform basic mathematic operations.

User stories document requirements with particular attention to the end user's point of view.

# INVEST

Another route to take, instead of writing the "As a ... I want... so that..." is to INVEST in good user stories:

1. **Independent**: There should be no dependencies between user stories.
2. **Negotiable**: User stories are reminders to collaborate, the card is not set in stone.
3. **Valuable** to the customer: Avoid user stories that only have technical value.
4. **Estimatable**:
    - User stories should be small. If they are not small enough to estimate, then split the user story up.
    - Split a user story up into research and real work if the developers do not have the right technical knowledge.
    - Collaborate with the customer to understand any missing domain knowledge.
5. **Small**: Stories should be small.
6. **Testable**: A user story must be testable. A story must be able to pass its acceptance tests, which means that it is complete.

## Who Writes the Tests?

The customer should write the user stories because the customer is in the best position to know the desired functionality.
