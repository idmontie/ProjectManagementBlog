## What is Planning Poker?

Planning Poker is an agile estmiating and planning technique that is consensus based.

Steps:

1. Everyone on the team that is going to help estimating (ie, the Development Team), holds cards with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100.
2. The Product Owner reads a user story.
3. The team discusses the feature.
4. Each member then privately selects a card to represent his or her estimate.
5. All cards are revealed at the same time.
6. If all estimators selected the same value, that becomes the estimate. If not, the team discusses their choices, and then the process is restarted for the same user story.
7. A consensus should be reached. If the team cannot read a consensus after a few rounds, then the item should be deferred until additional information can be acquired.
