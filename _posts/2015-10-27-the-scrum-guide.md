The Scrum Guide, available from ScrumGuides contains the definition of Scrum, Scrum's roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.

[Reading Material](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

## Definition of Scrum

**Scrum**: A framework where people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

The point of Scrum is that it is:

* Lightweight
* Simple to understand

However, it is:

* Difficult to master

It is not a process or technique for building products; rather it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Improvement is always the goal of Scrum.

## Scrum Theory

Empiricism is the name of the game. All decisions should be based on data. The process should be measured and optimized. The goal is to optimize predictability and control risk. At all points, the following should be upheld: **transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation**.

### Transparency
