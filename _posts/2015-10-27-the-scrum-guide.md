The Scrum Guide, available from ScrumGuides contains the definition of Scrum, Scrum's roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.

[Reading Material](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

## Definition of Scrum

**Scrum**: A framework where people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

The point of Scrum is that it is:

* Lightweight
* Simple to understand

However, it is:

* Difficult to master

It is not a process or technique for building products; rather it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Improvement is always the goal of Scrum.

## Scrum Theory

Empiricism is the name of the game. All decisions should be based on data. The process should be measured and optimized. The goal is to optimize predictability and control risk. At all points, the following should be upheld: **transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation**.

### Transparency

Observers should share a common understanding of what is being seen and what is happening.

### Inspection

Inspect Scrum artifacts frequently and progress toward a Sprint Goal. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed.

### Adaptation

The process or material being processed must be adjisted if one or more aspects of the Scrum process deviate outside of acceptable limits.

There are four (4) formal events for inspection and adaptation:

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

## The Scrum Team

The Scrum team is self-organizing and cross-functional. Cross-functional team shave all competencies needed to acommplish the work without depending on other parts that are are not part of the team.

Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing oppurtinities for feedback.  Incremental deliveries of "Done" ensure potentially useful version of the product.

### The Product Owner

The **Product Owner** is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the **Development Team**.

The Product Owner is the only individual responsible for managing and maintaining the Product Backlog. The Product Backlog management includes:

* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
* Ordering the items to best achieve goals and missions
* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all.
* Ensuring that the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed

The Product Owner remains accountable for the items; but may participate in the work to complete the items.

The Product Owner is an individual, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but all changes must go through the Product Owner.

The entire organization must respect the Product Owner's decisions. No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.

### The Development Team

The **Development Team** consists of individuals who work on incremental "Done" products in Sprints. Only members of the Development Team may create the **Increment**.

The Team self-organizes and manages their own work.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:

* Self-organizing - No one, and I mean no one, tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog tasks into Increments. Not even the Scrum Master
* Cross-functional - The team should have all the skills necessary to create a product Increment.
* No titles - There are no titles for Development Team members other than Developer. No exceptions.
* No sub-teams - There are no sub-teams in the Development Team.
* Accountability lies with the entire Development Team

### Development Team Size

The goal is to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. 3-9 is a good range. Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing work on the Sprint Backlog.

### The Scrum Master

The **Scrum Master** is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted the theory, practices, and rules are adhered to.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside of the Scrum Team understand their interactions with the Scrum Team.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in the following ways:

* Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
* Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
* Understanding and practicing agility
* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed

The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in the following ways:

* Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
* Helping the Development Team create high-value products
* Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress
* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
* Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not fully adopted

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

* Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
* Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
* Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
* Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization
