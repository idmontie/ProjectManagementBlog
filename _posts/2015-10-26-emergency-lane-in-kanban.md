Kanban is a technique for managing a software development process. Kanban focuses on finding the bottlenecks in a system, and adjusting the pipeline to meet that bottleneck so that quality of the overall pipeline does not suffer.

[Reading Material - What is Kanban?](http://kanbanblog.com/explained/), [Reading Material - How to Handle Unplanned Work in Kanban?](http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/16565/how-to-handle-unplanned-work-in-kanban?newsletter=1&nlcode=412697%7c4230)

One problem with Kanban is that because each section of the development pipeline can only have so many tasks in it at one time, it is unable to adjust to emergency tasks.

If the development section of the pipeline has three tasks in its In Progress section, and it only has the capacity for 3 tasks, when emergency tasks come in, it is unable to take and complete those tasks.

That's where a "Swimlane" comes into play.

An emergency swim lane of 1 task is added to the kanban board. Only critical, emergency tasks are allowed in the emergency swim lane and only 1 task is allowed at a time. Stakeholders must decide which problems are most critical if there are many emergency tasks. The lane must also be watched closely so that stakeholders do not use it as a loophole around the Kanban system.
