Kanban is a lean scheduling system developed in Japan. It helps visualize what to produce, how much to produce, and when to produce it.

Kanban works in conjunction in scrum. It utilizes visual queues.

Start with a board and visual cards that repesent items in your product backlog. The visual nature of the board helps keep track of what is new, in progress, and done.

Kanban imposes limits (Work In Progress limits). It helps create visualize bottlenecks in your pipeline.

It helps manage day-to-day development.
