Continued: We just finished discussing what a Sprint was and how it worked. Next we will look at the Daily Scrum, Sprint Reviews, and more.

[Reading Material](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

## Daily Scrum

The **Daily Scrum** is a **15 minute** time-boxed event for the Development Team. In the Daily Scrum, the team synchronizes activities and creates a plan for the next 24 hours. Work is inspected since the last Daily Scrum and work is forcasted for what can be done before the next one.

The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day.

The Development Team members must explain:

* What did I do yesterday? Specifically, what did I do that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
* What will I do today? Specifically, what will I do to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
* What implediments are preventing me from meeting the Sprint Goal?

Progress is inspected, helping ensure that the Development Team meets the Sprint Goal.

Only the Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum; ensuring this is the job of the Scrum Master.

## Sprint Review

A **Sprint Review** is held at the end of the Sprint. In it, the Increment is inspected and the Product Backlog is adapted.

The Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.

The is a four hour time boxed meeting for one month Sprints. Two week Sprints usually have a 2 hour meeting.

The Increment is presented to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

The following elements are part of the Sprint Review:

* The Scrum Team and stakeholders are invited by the Product Owner
* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done"
* The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved
* The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment
* The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands; projects likely completion dates based on the progress to date
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input into the next Sprint Planning
* Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next
