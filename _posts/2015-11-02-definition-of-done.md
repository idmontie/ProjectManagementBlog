The Definition of done is a checklist of valuable activities required to product software; a simple list, like writing code, coding comments, unit testing, integration testing, release notes, design documents, etc, that add verifiable and demonstrable value to the product.

The Definition of Done is crucial to a highly functioning Scrum team.

The Definition of Done helps the team focus on what must be completed in order to built software while eliminating wasteful activities.

It is the primary reporting mechanism for team members.

There can be defferent Definitions of Done at various levels:

* Definition of Done fora feature, story, or product backlog item
* Definition of Done for a sprint (colletion of features developed within a sprint)
* Definition of Done for a release (potentially shippable state)

To determine whether a given activity belongs to the Definition of Done for a feature, a sprint, or a release, ask yourself the following:

* Can we do this activity for each feature? If not, then
* Can we do this activity for each sprint? If not, then
* We have to do this activity for our release

Common causes for impediments include:

* Team does not have the skilset to incorporate activities into the Definition of Done for a sprint or for a feature
* Team does not hacve the right set of tools
* Team memebrs are executing their sprint in mini-waterfalls

Definition of Done is not static; it can change over time.

Definition of Done is an auditable checklist.
