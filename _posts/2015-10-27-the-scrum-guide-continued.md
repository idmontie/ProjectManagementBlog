Continued: We just finished discussing different roles in Scrum. Next we will look at the different events that happen in Scrum.

[Reading Material](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

Events in Scrum create regularity and minimize the need for meetings. All events are time-boxed events - there is a maximum duration for each event.  Each evetn is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something.

## The Sprint

The **Sprint** is the heart of Scrum. It is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releaseable product Increment is created. Once a Sprint beings, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. 

Sprints should have consistent durations so that they can be analyzed and planned for appropriately.

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* Scope may be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned

Each Sprint is like a project: there is a clear start and end, with a specific goal and Increment.

Sprints are limited to one calendar month, but most organizations are using two week Sprints.

Sprints help enable predictability by ensuring regular inspection and adaption of progress toward a Sprint Goal.


### Cancelling a Sprint

A Sprint **can** be cancelled; but, only by the Product Owner. The Sprint can be cancelled if they Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. If a company changed direction, technology conditions change, etc, then a goal can change and the current Sprint can be cancelled.

All completed work is reviewed by the Product Owner and determines whether to accept the work or not. All incomplete items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.


### Sprint Planning

The plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Planning is time-boxed at 8 hours for a one-month Sprint, or about 4 hours for a 2 week Sprint. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master also ensures that planning is kept within the time-box.

### Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?

- The Development Team: forecast the functionaltiy that will ber developed during the Sprint.
- The Product Owner: discuss the objective of that Sprint and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint would achieve that Sprint Goal.
- The Entire Team: understand the work of the Sprint.

Input:

- The Product Backlog
- The latest product Increment
- Proejcted capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint
- Past performance of the Development Team

Output:

- A Sprint Goal
- Items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint

### Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?

The Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint.

The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Spring Backlog.

Enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint.
