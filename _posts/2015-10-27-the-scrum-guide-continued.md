Continued: We just finished discussing different roles in Scrum. Next we will look at the different events that happen in Scrum.

[Reading Material](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

Events in Scrum create regularity and minimize the need for meetings. All events are time-boxed events - there is a maximum duration for each event.  Each evetn is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something.

## The Sprint

The **Sprint** is the heart of Scrum. It is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releaseable product Increment is created. Once a Sprint beings, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. 

Sprints should have consistent durations so that they can be analyzed and planned for appropriately.

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* Scope may be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned
