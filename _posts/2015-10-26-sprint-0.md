Sprint 0 is an unofficial approach to kickstarting Scrum.  It is not part of the offical Scrum Guide.

[Reading Material](http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/16578/what-should-be-part-of-sprint-0?newsletter=1&nlcode=412697%7c4230), [Reading Material - What is Sprint Zero?](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/09/sprint_zero)

All that is needed to start Scrum is a development team, a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and a backlog that covers at least 1 sprints worth of work. During this time, the team estimates the most important features and agrees on a definition of done.

Sprint 0 usually incorporates:

1. Get some quality items on the Product Backlog
1. Setting up continuous integration and source control
2. Deciding on a testing approach
3. Configuring release automation
4. Settings up task tracking tools
5. Determining high level architecture
6. Agreeing on a **definition of done**
8. Write a piece of real code, no matter how small

It should last a few days at most, no more than a week.
