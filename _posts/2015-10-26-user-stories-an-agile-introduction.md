User stories are one of the primary development artifacts for Scrum and Extereme Programming project teams.

A **user story** is a very high-level definition of a requirement, which contains just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it.

[Reading Material](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm)

A user story is a reminder to have a conversation with your customer (aka project stakeholders). Another way to put it is that is a reminder to do just-in-time analysis. They are slim, high level requirements artifacts.

User stories are small - smaller than use cases or usage scenarios:

> Students can purchase monthly parking passes online.

> Parking passes can be paid via credit cards

etc


1. **Stakeholders write user stories**: The stakeholders should write the user stories, not the developers.
2. **Use the simplest tool**: Use index cards
3. **Remember non-functional requirements**: stories can beused to describe a wide variety of requirements types. Usage requirements and technical requirements are also important.
4. **Indicate the estimated size**: Assign points to each card, relative to the other cards.
5. **Indicate the priority**: Prioritize cards, requirements, bugs, operations, etc. Project stakeholders should prioritize tasks. High/medium/low is often used.
6. **Optionally include a unique identifier**: Label cards with case numbers or some other way of maintaining traceability between the user story and other artifacts (such as acceptance tests).

Example:

> 173. Students can purchase parking passes.
>
> Priority: High
> Estimate: 4

## Formalizing the Process

> As a [role] I want [something] so that [benefit].

Mike Cohn in *User Stories Applied* suggests a fmore formal approach too writing user stories. Using the above example helps formalize the process. It helps you thinl about who a certain feature is built for and why. 

## Planning

User stories affect the following planning process on agile projects:

1. **Scheduling**: 
2. **Estimating**:
