Continued: In this section, we will look into Scrum Artifacts, like the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Increment.

[Reading Material](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

Scrum Artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

## Product Backlog

The **Product Backlog** is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availablity and ordering

A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and best understood requirements.It evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves.

It is dynamic, constantly chaning to identify what the product needs in order to be appropriate, competitive, and useful.

The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requiremetns, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases. The items have attributes of a description, estimate, and value.

Feedback from the marketplace will add to the Product Backlog. Requiremetns never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact.

Changes to business requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.

One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on a Project, even if there are multiple Scrum Teams.
